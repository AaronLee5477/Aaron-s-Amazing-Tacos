This website is my Code Louisville project and is for a fictional taco shop that
has online ordering. To access this website, please clone or download the files
open the index.html

The index.html page is a simple about page but the paragraphs have lipsum content,
but the link to the Louisville City FC homepage is functional.

The order.html page allows you to order these fictional tacos and will allow you
to view these in a modal cart, however the checkout button will lead to a dead end.

The contact.html page has an embedded google maps that links to the future site
of the LCFC stadium which is where my taco store would be located. The phone and
email links are functional but the number and address are not.

Thank you for viewing my site.
